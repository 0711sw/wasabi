//! Event recording system for analytics and audit trails.
//!
//! Provides a trait-based abstraction over event sinks. Events are typed structs
//! that implement [`Event`] (via derive macro) and get serialized to JSON before
//! being sent to the configured backend.
//!
//! Use [`NoopEventRecorder`] during development or when event recording is disabled.
//! In production, use [`firehose::FirehoseEventRecorder`] to stream events to AWS.
